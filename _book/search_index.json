in embedded technology. Well at least remotely interested (hopefully). Or you just must be curious what all this is about. Whatever your reason be, thank you for reading and I urge you to go on till the end. Just for the reason that there is a chance at the end of this, you might learn something new. If there is anything I have learnt in all these years it is we must always learn from everything around us. In the words of Steve Jobs “Stay Hungry Stay Foolish”.\nThroughout this the only thing I expect from you is the desire to learn. Please do keep in mind that this is not some local author textbook or some big reference book. I shall be keeping to the point and hence you must read through the whole thing. Every line and word.\nAt the end of this, I promise you will have learnt something. For some it may not be technical knowledge. You shall learn the correct approach to things. This is something that is rarely taught in our education system. Though this is the one most important skillset we need in the future.\nKnowledge is not something that should be kept locked up and sold. Most of what I have learnt throughout the years is thanks to people who were kind enough to put their work online free of cost. Many workshops only give a feel of doing stuff. All the things are provided by them. Students don’t actually get in depth experience and what they learn is only superficial. While our current engineering education system does not even do that. In India, engineering is only based on how much you can learn by heart. It’s like “raat sakte ho, chalo paas ho gaye”. Even if one tries to actually learn there is basically no point as everyone knows questions are going to come from the local author book. “Yaar marks toh future mei bhaut important hai na...” The whole thing is very frustrating to those who actually want to learn and do something.\nThe second reason for making this is that the grasping speeds of everyone is different. I could never pay attention in lectures as my attention span is a whole complete of ten minutes. So I believe freedom is necessary. Freedom to go as one wishes, at the pace one wishes. In the end what matters is how much you learn.\nThe main aim of this project, for me is to reduce the prototyping time. Every year there are so many students with amazing project ideas. But our current system is such that information is not readily available and our college syllabus does not teach anything practical at all. So when students start with projects, a lot of time is wasted in doing things from scratch. When the hardware finally is ready the semester ends and the innovative ideas are lost. In a country like India with so much talent this should not happen. Ideas being lost or forgotten is a huge mistake on our part.\nWhat I am trying to do through this kit, is reduce the time required to get the hardware ready. This will enable us to directly work on our ideas in the Application Domain. Keep in mind, this is just the beginning. You are about to unlock the path to a very interesting domain of engineering. The possibilities of what you can do are limitless. Finally, the joy we get when we make something and it works is amazing!\n"},"foreword.html":{"url":"foreword.html","title":"Foreword","keywords":"","body":"Foreword \nSome Rights Reserved.\nYou are free to change this hardware, duplicate it, and make your own for non-commercial purposes.\nEvery kit has been tested. The only active component ATmega 328 has been thoroughly tested by programming and bootloading each IC before packing. The passive components cannot be tested individually before packing. If there are any errors in those we sincerely apologise. Due to the small cost replacing the passive components won’t be an issue.\nIn case of errors while implementing this kit we urge you to first try things out yourself. Due to the small scale nature and direct involvement in making each kit, it is highly unlikely that a defective piece gets sold.\nYou can always call up the team at Sugar Plum Labs for queries advice or even if you get a random urge to discuss the string-loop theory, our contact details are given in the kit.\nAny sort of suggestions, scope for improvement are welcome.\nIf you are interested in working with us, then we welcome you with open arms.\nSpecial thanks to Sparkfun, Adafruit for pioneering the open hardware movement and obviously Arduino for simplifying our life.\n"},"how_and_where_to_use_this_board.html":{"url":"how_and_where_to_use_this_board.html","title":"How and Where to Use This Board","keywords":"","body":"How and Where to Use This Board \nThis board has been designed for rapid prototyping, tinkering and experimenting. The nature of this board is such that after you finish making it and testing it for the first time, it has a very high reliability. It has been specifically made such that you can make any change to it physically as you wish (for example adding extra pins, headers, specific connections, etc.).\nAll components on this boards are in the DIP (Dual in Line) package so that they are easily solderable and also desolderable. Hence now even if some component gets damaged while experimenting you can change only that specific component and continue as good as new. This is a great advantage as compared to the Arduino Uno we get in the market which if damaged cannot be easily repaired.\nAs this board has a very high reliability it can be used as a starting point in all your projects.When we start with new projects we need some reliable generalised hardware upon which we base the further project. Then using this generalised hardware we test all our project ideas rapidly. As it is a tested and reliable hardware time is not wasted in debugging of the hardware. Now once all the parts of the project are tested we can replace the generalised hardware with a specific one. What this does is it provides us with an interface we want, it eliminates the need of jumpers, connectors, breadboards and thus greatly reduces size and complexity.\nSo now whenever some nice idea comes in your head, just take out this board and start making!\n"},"getting_started/":{"url":"getting_started/","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started \n"},"getting_started/what_you_will_need.html":{"url":"getting_started/what_you_will_need.html","title":"What You Will Need:","keywords":"","body":"What You Will Need: \nTo get through with this you will need some time, dedication and a certain amount of patience.\nAlong with that you will need 10% luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain and….. (For those who did not get the reference please ignore… sorry)\nSo on a serious note you will be needing the following things. If you are not sure about all this and want to just get an idea, you can borrow most of the needed stuff, colleges also have these. If you are even slightly serious about making stuff and DIY electronics then I strongly suggest you get yourself this equipment.\n\nDigital Multimeter\n\nThere is a wide variety available ranging from 100 rupee ones to 5000 rupee industrial standard. For most part the 100 rupee one is sufficient. But if you are considering doing more projects like this I would advise you to invest a bit more and get something a bit better around 300 – 500 rupees.\nThis is the one we usually get at a hundred bucks.\nFunction Knob.You have options like DC Voltmeter, AC Voltmeter and Ammeter\nhttps://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSfwcJL1xN1IK5lhE-YiC7klKyGOmBa4kz7LMnwLuc8g2_JbaLD1w\nInsert probes here.Check which function is being used and choose hole accordingly.\nAlways disconnect the probes before changing the mode of the DMM. Suppose you are measuring voltage and suddenly change the mode to Ammeter, your system will get short circuited and damaged!\n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQXI8YMO77S4wbMGubkpE8kTYJ_x30Z9BM-QxY9uCDhg5dcq56oSoldering Gun The soldering gun we most easily get in these areas is the yellow coloured Solderon soldering iron (25 Watt). This is completely sufficient for all DIY projects and is even capable of SMD soldering.Most soldering guns come with a flat ringed metal tip. For SMD work you can use the pointed tip. There is a different type of tip available known as a coated tip. It is about 3 times the cost of a normal tip but gives superior performance and lasts a lot longer. If you are going to do a lot of soldering work give it a try.\n\nSolder Metal and Flux Solder metal for obvious purposes. The flux is optional but it makes soldering a whole lot easier.\n\n\nhttp://3.imimg.com/data3/YQ/RI/MY-10536612/silder-flux-250x250.jpeg![](../assets/picture_8.jpg)http://s3.amazonaws.com/emimg/Products/NN-156/1B.JPG\n\nWire Stripper and similar tools. This again is optional depending upon your project.\n\nOther than the above stuff all that you need for the ArduDIY is provided in this kit.\n"},"contents.html":{"url":"contents.html","title":"Contents","keywords":"","body":"Contents \n\n\n\nComponent Name\nValue\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nResistor\n4k7\n3\n\n\nCeramic Capacitor\n0.1uF\n6\n\n\n\n22pF\n2\n\n\nElectrolytic Capacitor\n47uF\n1\n\n\n\n100uF\n1\n\n\nDiode\n1N4007\n2\n\n\nLED\n3mm\n2\n\n\nCrystal\n16MHz\n1\n\n\n7805\n-\n1\n\n\nReset Switch\n-\n1\n\n\nSlider Switch\n-\n1\n\n\nIC Base\n28 Pin\n1\n\n\nBattery Connector\n-\n1\n\n\nSingle Strand Wire\n-\n1\n\n\nBergstrip\n-\n\n\n\nPCB Mount Relimate\n6 pin\n1\n\n\n\n2 pin\n1\n\n\nWired Relimate Connector\n6 pin\n1\n\n\nBootloaded ATmega328\nP-PU\n1\n\n\nBox Header\n10 Pin\n1\n\n\nArduDIY PCB\n-\n1\n\n\nConverter Board\nCP2102\n1\n\n\n\n"},"how_to_go_about.html":{"url":"how_to_go_about.html","title":"How to go about","keywords":"","body":"How to go about \nSo, the right approach is to read this and side by side and practically perform.

Earlier we had to use one brand of microcontrollers, a second software to write the code, a separate compiler and a fourth software to upload the code. Arduino does all these things for us. That is one of the reasons it is so popular. The Arduino hardware and software was designed for artists, designers, hobbyists, hackers, newbies, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino can interact with buttons, LEDs, motors, speakers, GPS units, cameras, the internet, and even your smart-phone or your TV!\nNow open source means that the code developed is free for everyone to view and edit. The outcome of this is that thousands of talented coders are working on Arduino as we speak. The whole system is constantly developing and everyone gets the benefits. The whole community is friendly and all question are answered on the forums. Now as this is open source a lot of libraries are readily available. A library is a set of codes specific to some application. Suppose you want to run a servo motor, to write the actual code can be quite cumbersome so we use a library developed for servo motors. This library contains all functions required in one package.\nArduino programming is done in a simplified version of C++, one just needs to know the basics and then can start programming right away.\nWhat Arduino does is it greatly simplifies the whole code writing process. This is especially useful for people like us, who are more interested in implementing things rather than dealing with the whole computer part of it. How does it simplify the code? Let me give you an example.Suppose we want to run a motor with variable rpm. For this we need the PWM signal from the microcontroller. Now in traditional approach the code would be:\nArduino\nTraditional Code\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\Code_trad.jpg\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\Code_Arduino.jpg\nYES!! All that was reduced to only two lines!And this is just the most basic example, you will realise how great Arduino is once you start using it.\nJust to give you a Perspective, this is the Arduino Header\nNow you must be thinking “How is this possible!? Is it really this easy?” Well yes. It is so because hundreds of people have already put in effort. It’s not like the code required has magically shrunk. There is a code behind what we write and that is huge. See what the people at Arduino did is that they created standard libraries and functions for everyone to use. So the extra lines you see in the first code are actually there but they are being used by us through the functions defined by the creators of Arduino.\nIf you want to actually read it, just open “arduino.h” located in the program files.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\Arduino_h.jpg\n"},"arduino/the_microcontroller.html":{"url":"arduino/the_microcontroller.html","title":"The Microcontroller:","keywords":"","body":"The Microcontroller: \nMicrocontrollers are everywhere! From our watches to our phone, in our cars, our homes. Almost each and every electronics appliance available today has the microcontroller at its heart.\nSo what are these microcontrollers and why are they so popular?\nYou must have read the age old definition that “A microprocessor does not have RAM, ROM, I/O or memory and these have to be added externally while a microcontroller has memory, I/O, RAM and ROM on the same chip”\nLet’s understand this a bit better.\nInitially there were analog circuits in electronics. This was a complex field and only people with lab coats and years of experience could work in it. Then the transistor was discovered and came the era of digital circuits. Large scale fabrication began and prices were lowered. Multifunction integrated circuits were introduced and this put never before available technology in the hands of the common man (well basically hobbyists, enthusiasts, engineers, makers). Then, someone suddenly put a question: Why should not we make a universal component? A cheap, universal integrated circuit that could be programmed and used in any field of electronics, device or wherever needed?\nOk, so when microcontrollers first came out there was a huge demand. But the problem was that everyone had different needs. One wanted to make a washing machine, another wanted home automation and a third just wanted to turn lights on and off. The manufacturers were in a fix. Up till now ICs used to be very specific. How could they fulfil everyone’s needs? So they came up with a very generic design. Multiple functions were bundled up in a single package. But to provide so many functions there would have to be a lot of pins (pins are the only source of input/output/communication/etc. on a microcontroller). So they came up with the ingenious idea of multiplexing many functions on a single pin. Now the same pin could be used as an input, output, analog converter, communication, interrupt. Hence the user could use whatever he wanted and just ignore the rest. The same microcontrollers were now open for everyone to use as they wanted. Thus was formed the modern day microcontroller with incredible power to the user.\nSo basically a microcontroller is a combination of I/O, ROM, RAM and other function on the same chip. But how exactly is this useful? Ok, suppose you are a washing machine manufacturer. You need something to work as the brain of your machine. You have two broad options, a microcontroller and a microprocessor. If you use a microprocessor you will have to add all of its peripherals and this will increase your size and cost (keep in mind the highest priority in industry is cost saving, whatever they tell you). So you go for the microcontroller. Now the need in a washing machine is very specific. You have some buttons as inputs, and motors as outputs and a few sensors to monitor water levels and other such stuff. So how to decide which microcontroller to use? The first thing is we look at all the functions we need. We have input pins for the buttons, output pins for the display, PWM pins to run the motors and Analog to Digital converter pins for the sensor input. Once we have this we decide on the manufacturer. This is based on the comfort level in using them. Some common manufacturers are Texas Instruments, Atmel, PIC, Philips (NXP), and Renesas. Although the basic coding concept remains the same each manufacturer uses a different toolkit. This brings up the comfort part. Atmel, NCP and PIC are easy to use and also have a large support base of users. Texas on the other hand can be harder without prior knowledge.\nArduino exclusively runs on Atmel microcontrollers. Most of these are from the Atmega series. Few of the ICs used are Atmega 8/88, Atmega 328, and Atmega 2560. Thought the architecture and operating frequency is similar they differ in number of pins and functions and the flash memory (flash memory is where we store the code).\nThe name of our IC.(28 pin DIP package)\nThe boards we will be making shall be a version of Arduino UNO. The technical name of our board is a derivative of Arduino Duemilanove. The controller used in these boards is the Atmega 328.\nThese are its specifications:\nMicrocontrollerAtmega328Operating Voltage5VInput Voltage (recommended)7-12VInput Voltage (limits)6-20VDigital I/O Pins14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)Analog Input Pins6 (ADC)DC Current per I/O Pin40 mADC Current for 3.3V Pin50 mAFlash Memory32 KB (ATmega328) of which 2 KB used by bootloaderSRAM2 KB (ATmega328)EEPROM1 KB (ATmega328)Clock Speed16 MHz\nOur board differs from the Arduino Uno in the way code is uploaded onto the IC. The Uno uses another controller (Atmega 88) to act as the interface for uploading code. We shall be using the CP2102 to act as an interface between our computer and the Arduino Board.\n"},"arduino/what_makes_a_microcontroller_arduino.html":{"url":"arduino/what_makes_a_microcontroller_arduino.html","title":"What makes a Microcontroller Arduino! ","keywords":"","body":"What makes a Microcontroller Arduino! \nIf you buy an ATmega328 from the market and plug it into your board it won’t work. The board wouldn’t respond at all. That’s because the microcontroller we bought from the market isn’t programmed to behave as an Arduino. Arduino has defined set parameters for communication between the IDE and the microcontroller. The microcontroller should be initially programmed such that it can interface with the Arduino IDE before we actually start using it as an Arduino.\nWhat we actually do when we program a microcontroller to behave as an Arduino is change its bootloader to the “Arduino Bootloader”.\nWhat is a bootloader?The bootloader is the little program that runs when you turn the Arduino on, or press the reset button. Its main function is to wait for the Arduino software on your computer to send it a new program for the Arduino, which it then writes to the memory on the Arduino. This is important, because normally you need a special device to program the Arduino. The bootloader is what enables you to program the Arduino using just the USB cable.\nWithout the Arduino bootloader we would not have been able to program the microcontroller so easily.\nThus the Arduino Bootloader is what makes our ATmega 328 an Arduino.\n"},"ardudiy/":{"url":"ardudiy/","title":"ArduDIY","keywords":"","body":"ArduDIY \nSo now that we have gotten ourselves acquainted with microcontrollers and Arduino lets start on our current project the ArduDIY.

Due to this you will not be able to use Arduino shields but I urge you to try developing your very own. The pins of this board are breadboard and 0 pcb compatible so go ahead make what you want!\nThe reason this board was not made pin compatible with the Arduino is so that users could develop a better understanding of how the board actually works and is routed.

We can also communicate with the Arduino Board using the serial monitor of the IDE. It uses the USB port of the computer. The console displays status messages and also warnings and errors.\nWe write the code in the text editor part of this program. In Arduino our code file is called a sketch and saved with the extension “.ino”\n"},"ardudiy/converter.html":{"url":"ardudiy/converter.html","title":"Converter:","keywords":"","body":"Converter: \nOur board and the Arduino IDE running on the computer need to communicate. Now in hardware communication is done with the help of protocols. Think of protocols as languages of hardware communication. Protocols define the way communication should take place and also the data that can be sent and received (Similar to grammar and words in a language). Some commonly used protocols are RS-232, USB, UART, USART, and SPI. When two people are talking if one speaks English and the other speaks French the conversation will be pointless, similarly for two boards to communicate they must support the same protocol. The USB protocol is somewhat of a high level protocol, the IC we are using (Atmega328) does not support it so we need device to act as a translator in between our computer and our board. This is the purpose of our converter board. The board communicates with our computer using USB protocol and with our controller using UART (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) protocol. It is powered using the 5V supply on our Computer but we shall not be using the same supply to power our ArduDIY board. The reason for this is that if something goes wrong in our circuit it can damage the Serial Port on the computer.\nNow this converter board is universal. You can use it with any other board and any other microcontroller as well. It is a serial to USB converter. The signal voltage of this board is 3.3V, it is compatible with all ATmega microcontrollers.\nIt’s most important use is that we shall be using it as a programmer to upload our program to the Arduino.

UART is a serial protocol so the data transmitted by one chip is received by the other on the same line. Hence this configuration.\n"},"ardudiy/ardudiy_board.html":{"url":"ardudiy/ardudiy_board.html","title":"ArduDIY Board:","keywords":"","body":"ArduDIY Board: \nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\Board Diagram.jpgNow let’s look at our Arduino board. On a layout level it can be split into the following parts. We look at it this way as it makes understanding it easier.\nNow every board has a corresponding schematic. Whenever we make a printed circuit board usually we have to create two files. The schematic (.sch) and the board (.brd) file. The schematic file must be created first.\nThe schematic file defines all the components that shall be used and the connection between all the pins of the components. Take for example we want to make a board with an AND gate. Before starting, the first thing to do is look at the datasheet of the IC 7408. This is a quad two input AND gate, that means there are four two input AND gates in this package. It may look huge and scary at first but believe me, as you read more and more datasheets it will get easier you will realise exactly which parameters to search in a datasheet and soon you will be able to understand a whole datasheet in just minutes.\n\n\n\nLogic Diagram\nTo understand what type the gate is.\n\n\n\n\nPin Layout\nThis is important for routing.\n\n\nPower Supply\nPower supply must always be within permissible limits.\n\n\nLogic Voltage\nThis is the input/output voltage the pins support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the parameters we shall look at now in the datasheet are:\nSo now that we have studied the electrical characteristics of the IC we are using, let’s start with the schematic. Let’s look at what all we will be needing on the board we make.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\7408_BlockDiagram.jpg\nPower Supply\nNow let’s put this in schematic format (a little prior working knowledge of eagle is needed. I shall soon be making a tutorial on eagle basics.)\nInput Port\nOutput Port\nAll the four gates of the IC along with Pin Numbers.\nThere are no connectionsas we are not using those pins.\nYou can see the lines represent just connections and not the actual physical layout. So here we have just defined all the components needed along with the connections for a simple AND gate board. This was just to get you accustomed to the design process.\nNow that were familiar let’s look at the schematic of our ArduDIY Board:\n\nHave a look at this and try to understand whatever you can. Every component is named. Look at where it is connected and see if you can understand why it is connected there. Labels are used to make the wiring in this schematic easier. Labelling means that in the schematic all same named wires (or nets) are connected. So all labels saying “VCC” are actually connected. When designing you can use the show command of eagle to observe the complete connection. At the centre is our microcontroller (Atmega328) and there are 28 pins coming out of this package and every pin has a specific purpose. If we want the controller to work as it should every pin must be properly connected as per instructions given in the datasheet. Also take the PCB in your hand and see where each component in the schematic is placed. Try to locate all components. (This is important in order to understand routing of the board)\nOk so once you have had a good and through look at the above circuit you can go ahead.\nHere is the same schematic with blocks based on function. Check how G:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\Scematic Explanation.jpgmany of them you guessed correctly.\nThis is the bare minimum of what all is required for the microcontroller to run. Capacitors are used for decoupling (to remove noise or varying elements). Resistors are used to pull-up and for current limiting.\nNow that we have seen the schematic let’s look at the board file. The board file has an extension .brd and it defines the actual physical layout.\n\nAs you can see it is harder to realise the connections between components in the physical layout. That is the reason we need to first define the components and their connection in the schematic file and then proceed to layout.\n"},"components.html":{"url":"components.html","title":"Components","keywords":"","body":"Components \n\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\DSC_1233-1.jpgLet’s have a look at all the components present in here so that it shall be easier to solder the board.\nResistor:- 4k7 or 4700Ohms.\n22pF\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\IMG_20151212_204123.jpg\nLong Legs\nSmall head\n22AEC\nCeramic Capacitor:-Ok we have ceramic capacitors of two different values.

It helps in rapid prototyping, repairing and building stuff from scratch.\nProper soldering is essential.\nIf a joint is not soldered properly the board won’t work as expected and debugging is very hard when there are 40 to 50 solder joints along with components, we can’t find out if a component is faulty or the soldering is. Thus take utmost care while soldering and double check each joint.\nThe tools we shall require for soldering have been listed earlier. Here is a list just to recheck.\n\nSoldering Gun\n\nSolder Metal\n\nWire Cutter\n\nFlux (Optional though preferred)\n\nWet Sponge (Optional)\n\nSoldering Gun\n\n\nThe soldering gun we most easily get in these areas is the yellow coloured Solderon soldering iron. This is completely sufficient for all DIY projects and is even capable of SMD soldering. If you are soldering more intricate stuff I recommend using a soldering station. The advantage with these is that they come with temperature setting, proper grounding for ESD protection and other such facilities which help in better soldering. Please conduct proper research before buying a soldering station. As far as possible do not buy Chinese replicas, they seem cheap but will give you problems within a month.\nMost soldering guns come with a flat ringed metal tip. For SMD work you can use the pointed tip. There is a different type of tip available known as a coated tip. It is about 3 times the cost of a normal tip but gives superior performance and lasts a lot longer. If you are going to do a lot of soldering work give it a try.\nSoldering is an art, every individual has his own soldering style. If you are practise soldering you too will come to realise this. You can make out who has soldered a board just by looking at it. I urge you to look at the basic techniques and then develop your own style. There are many options, you could go with whatever is the fastest or whatever seems the safest or anything!\n\nFlux\n\nWhat flux basically does is it removes the metal oxide layer which is formed due to high heat. This layer is the blackened stuff you see on your soldering gun and on the board. Oxidation eats away at the metal and comes in the way of a proper solder joint. It can give rise to dry solder. There are many types of flux like liquid flux, flux paste etc..\n\nSolder Wire\n\nSolder wire is easily available is most electronics shops. Observe the thickness before buying, if it seems too thick it may give problems melting properly.\n\nWet Sponge\n\nIf you have a soldering gun stand you must have noticed a small yellow thick sponge on the front. This is meant to clean the gun and must be wetted before use. Just rub the tip of your gun over the sponge. Do this with a swiping movement without maintaining contact for too long.\nHow to Solder\n\nCheck that you soldering gun is properly heated. (You should be able to feel its heat near your face from a distance of 10 cm.)\n\nPlace the component through the holes. Fasten it if necessary by bending the pins outwards.\n\nTouch the soldering iron on the joint you want to solder. Use the flat tip so that it covers the most area.\n\nAfter the joint is sufficiently heated, bring the solder metal into contact of the joint and gun.\n\nThe metal will melt and flow towards the joint.\n\nWhen enough solder has melted into the joint take the soldering metal away and simultaneously gently lift the soldering gun UP.\n\nAfter the solder has cooled check to see if it has stuck to the joint properly.\n\nA perfectly soldered joint is conical in shape.\n\nClean your soldering gun by tapping it in flux and/or using the wet sponge.\n\n\nAfter Soldering\n\nLet the joint cool a bit before moving anything.\n\nVisually check the joint to see if the solder has held on to the joint correctly. I have observed that visual inspection is many times the best method of checking.\n\nUse a DMM in continuity mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s start with the soldering. We go step by step starting from the small components first. Use this image as a reference. All components are labelled along with polarity where ever required.\nUse that Image as a reference for locating where components are. It is an image of the bare PCB board without any components. You will notice that as you go on soldering components it gets harder to spot where you have to solder new components.\nGo in this order for soldering the components, it will be easier this way. Tally the components with the quantity given. That way you will not miss out on any components.\n\n\n\nComponent Name\nValue\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nResistor\n4k7\n3\n\n\nCeramic Capacitor\n0.1uF\n6\n\n\n\n22pF\n2\n\n\n\nDO NOT SOLDER CAPACITOR C9 and RESISTOR R4.\nFor soldering the Electrolytic Capacitor, first identify which terminal is negative and which positive.The PCB has a marking for the positive terminal.\n\n\n\nElectrolytic Capacitor\n47uF\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100uF\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiode\n1N4007\n2\n\n\n\n\nLED\n3mm\n2\n\n\n\nSimilarly for the LEDs and diodes, first identify the anode and cathode.\nAnodePositive Terminal\nLonger Lead\nThe diodes have a clear marking to show the polarity (the side with the band is cathode or negative terminal).The Led on the other hand has no such marking.

Look at the diagram on the board properly and then connect accordingly. Remember there are two sets of switches in our reset switch. Solder it like this. Later keep in mind to check this with the DMM as, if this is not soldered in proper orientation, the board will continuously be in reset state and won’t work.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\DSC_1255-1.jpgG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\ArduDIY_Board.png\n\n\n\nIC Base\n28 Pin\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\IMG_20151212_204042.jpg\nFor the IC base, place it on the board and support it from the other side with your fingers (careful so that you do not burn yourself). Now solder two pins diagonally. After that you can solder the rest of the IC base with ease.\n\n\n\nBergstrip\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s solder the Bergstrip. Cut it out in pieces with a cutter. There is a technique to solder this easily. Initially solder just the first pin and adjust the Bergstrip by touching the other side, so you do not burn yourself. Once a pin is soldered you can continue with the complete strip. After doing that just retouch the first pin you soldered again. The single pin (1x1) Bergstrip soldering can be a bit tricky. Use someone’s help to hold the other side using forceps or a plier or if you are doing it yourself use the plastic housing to adjust the pin without touching it for too long.\nUse the image of the completely soldered board to get where bergstrips must be soldered.\n\n\n\n7805\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\nSlider Switch\n-\n1\n\n\n\nOk almost there, we now solder the slider switch and the voltage regulator. For the regulator look at the indication on the board for proper orientation.\n\n\n\nBattery Connector\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battery connector wires need to be soldered onto the board. There is also a provision for soldering a DC Jack on the board, you can proceed with what you are comfortable with. Just put the wire through the slot and solder it on the bottom. Look at the image below to get the positions for the red and black wires. You can also solder a DC jack here in case you are using an adapter.As you can see the original component on the board is a DC Jack.\nRed Wire\nBlack Wire\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\ArduDIY_Board.png\n\n\n\nSingle Strand Wire\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile soldering the wire, first cut the wire to proper length. An easy way to do this is to directly take a measurement by placing the wire on the board. Now strip the ends of the wire to expose the strand underneath. Once that is done place the wire in the two holes provided. Solder one end first, check, then solder the other point. As far as possible try to keep the wire as close/ flat to the PCB as possible. This is not only a good soldering practise but will also make the board neater and prevent the wire form coming in between other components.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_new\\DSC_1560.JPGG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\ArduDIY_Board.png\n\n\n\nPCB Mount Relimate\n6 pin\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n2 pin\n1\n\n\n\nWhen soldering the Relimate we must take care that it is soldered in the proper orientation. First identify the flap. When soldering the flap must be outwards. Use the print on the PCB as reference.\nThis is the flap.It is facing the outer edge of the board.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\ArduDIY_Board.pngG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_new\\DSC_1560.JPG\n\n\n\nBox Header\n10 Pin\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_new\\DSC_1560.JPGAlmost there, while soldering the box header first identify pin number 1 on both the header an on the PCB. To identify pin number 1 read the section above where all components are introduced (It is shown by a small arrow on the header as well as the board).\nPin number 1.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\ArduDIY_Board.png\n\n\n\nCrystal\n16MHz\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crystal is the last component we solder. This is because the quartz crystal is quite sensitive. Do not hold you soldering gun to its points for too long while soldering. But do place it properly (pressing it onto the surface so that that there is no space between the crystal and the PCB) and solder it thoroughly.\nNow that we are done soldering, take a break and look upon what you have made \nHere are some reference images.The DC jack is not included in this kit, you can solder it if you plan on powering this board using an adapter. The adapter can be 8V to 20V.Preferablly 12V.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_new\\DSC_1560.JPG\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_3\\DSC_1603.JPG\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_3\\DSC_1602.JPG\n"},"testing/":{"url":"testing/","title":"Testing ","keywords":"","body":"Testing \nNow that we are done soldering, before we actually start we need to perform some basic testing on the board.

Many times we absent-mindedly keep the board on your work table as it is. Our work table is littered with wires and small pieces of metal, especially the small strands we get after cutting the legs of a resistor or capacitor. These can touch and connect two points on our board and short circuit the whole system damaging the board.\nSometimes we also need to check the bottom soldered part of the board, so it’s not a good idea to permanently close off the bottom. The best solution is to use a thick cardboard and tape it on one side of your board. This way when using it the cardboard will cover the board and if needed the cardboard can be just folded off to access the board.\nTake any cardboard of good thickness (covers of our old hardbound notebooks works well) mark the boundaries of the PCB, and cut away. Stick only one side with scotch tape.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_3\\DSC_1606.JPG\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_3\\DSC_1604.JPG\n"},"software_&_programming/":{"url":"software_&_programming/","title":"Software & Programming","keywords":"","body":"Software & Programming \nBefore we begin you shall need to install two things. Firstly the Arduino IDE and secondly the drivers for our converter board.\nYou can get the latest Arduino Software at www.arduino.cc On their homepage select the download tab. At the time of writing this Arduino 1.6.6 was the latest version, though all higher versions will also work. Preferably use the Arduino Installer and not the ZIP file. It makes things easier. Once you have downloaded, install Arduino.\nNow we install the drivers for our software board. The converter IC on the board is CP2102. It is manufactured by Silicon Labs, we can obtain the drivers from their website. Just Google “CP2102 driver” It should probably be the first link. This is the full link. https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspxThe download page looks like this. Download the Drivers and install them.\nOnce you have installed the drivers you can plug in the converter board into your USB port.You will get a notification and the PC will auto detect. Now we have to know which COM port has been assigned to our converter board.(Basically how this works is that for any I/O device we connect to our PC, Windows assigns it a COM port number. To use this port we have to know the COM port number. )\nTo view the COM port on Windows 7 and above. First plug in the Converter Board into the USB. Then right click on “My Computer” and click on “Manage”.Then click on “Device Manager” on the left. After then click on “Ports (COM & LPT)” on the list that appears on the right.You will see the connected converter board along with the COM port name in brackets.If “Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge” cannot be seen here the drivers have not installed properly.\nThis is your COM port numberIt will be different on different PCs.\n1\n3\n2\n\nSo now that we know our COM port number, open the Arduino IDE.Before we can start programming, we will need to set some settings in the Arduino software.\nGo to Tools -> Board -> And select Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila\n\nSelect This.\nSelect This.\nNow go to Tools -> Processor and select ATmega328\n\nSelect This.\nSelect This.\nLastly go to Tools -> Port -> Now select the COM port of our converter board.

Hence care must be taken. Look at the way we plug in the Relimate.\nBasically the flap on the Relimate should be downwards.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\DSC_1256-1.jpgG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\splabcomponents\\DSC_1263-1.jpg\nFlap\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\CP2102_wiring.jpg\nOnce you have connected the Relimate, the whole arrangement should look like this:\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\attachments_new\\DSC_1561.JPG\nJust a little tip: when you want to remove the Relimate wire from the Arduino board, do not just pull it out. Doing that will reduce the life of your Relimate. The proper method to remove the Relimate is using your finger pull the Relimate in the direction of the flap while pulling it upwards. It should easily come off this way.\n"},"software_&_programming/lets_start_programming.html":{"url":"software_&_programming/lets_start_programming.html","title":"Let’s start Programming!!!","keywords":"","body":"Let’s start Programming!!! \nYou must know about “Hello World” it is the first program we try out whenever learning a new language. “Blink” is the Arduino equivalent of Hello World.

Before starting just brush up on the basics of C/C++. This is essential to understand the Arduino code.\nThe main important concepts you must cover are: syntax, data types, functions (in detail), condition statements (if-else, while, do while etc.), structures, classes (for advanced users and library manipulation). Most of the Arduino code is created using structures and classes. Hence we need proper knowledge of these and also how to access them (for example the dot operator used to access functions of objects of a particular class).Once you know C/C++ you will understand part of the code immediately when you read it. A big help is that Arduino functions are very well named. Just take care which letters are capital and which small. Let us look at the code you just ran.\nThis part defines the code example. And gives a brief explanation.\n/*\nBlink\nTurns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.\nMost Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the Uno and\nLeonardo, it is attached to digital pin 13. If you're unsure what\npin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check\nthe documentation at http://www.arduino.cc\nBefore we use any pin, we must first define how we are using it. Here we define a digital pin as OUTOUT\nThis example code is in the public domain.\nmodified 8 May 2014\nby Scott Fitzgerald\n*/\n// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board\nvoid setup() {\nOnce we define the pin we can use it.\n// initialize digital pin 13 as an output.\npinMode(13, OUTPUT);\n}\n// the loop function runs over and over again forever\nvoid loop() {\ndigitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)\ndelay(1000); // wait for a second\ndigitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW\ndelay(1000); // wait for a second\n}\nWhen you read this example code you will see how well it is commented. Arduino code examples are the best way to learn Arduino.\nOne approach to follow while learning Arduino is, first decide what you want to do (this depends what you was running using the Arduino) then search for code example available. The examples folder in Arduino itself contains a lot of code samples. Understand these code examples and then write your own code. DO NOT copy paste. Understand and write it yourself.\nThe coding convention followed by Arduino is a bit different. It is used throughout Arduino and if you are going to publish your code online it is recommended that you stick to the Arduino convention of writing. The most important thing in Arduino is PINS ARE NOT ACCESSED BY THE ACTUAL PIN NUMBER OF THE MICROCONTROLLER. Those who are familiar with embedded coding will remember that we always used to access registers (PORT, Data Direction) using the actual pin numbers.Instead the Arduino developers have come up with its own pin mapping and naming configuration. This widely divides the pins as Digital and Analog. Now we don’t have to use registers at all, Arduino takes care of this for us. Digital pins are those which can input and output digital values. Along with this they also have pin specific functions. PWM pins are a part of digital pins. Please note that while using PWM, you will have to use only those pins which are capable of producing a PWM output. The analog pins are those which have ADC (Analog to Digital Converter Capabilities). A thing to note here is that all Analog pins can be used as digital pins but digital pins cannot be used as analog pins.\nAnother thing you will notice when you start reading Arduino code is the efficient use of macros and identifiers. So suppose you are using a red coloured hitswitch in your project, now this hitswitch is connected on pin 7 on the Arduino. So when we write the code whenever we want to access anything related to this hitswitch we use it like digitalRead(7);or pinMode(7);Obviously we will use these functions multiple times at different places in our code. Later we want to use pin number 7 as a Led indicator. Now what? We will have to sit and change every instance of 7 to something else. That is a pain. So what we do in in the beginning define the pin number eg;int red_hitswitch = 7;Now wherever we want to access this pin we just replace it with red_hitswitch.digitalRead(red_hitswitch);or pinMode(red_hitswitch);This makes reading and writing the code easier and now even if we want to change the pin assignment in the future we just chance the definition and nothing else.\nG:\\data1\\ArduDIY\\Images\\arduinoUnoPinMap.jpgThis is the pin mapping Arduino uses:\nLet’s go over the basics of what you will require to get started. Now for a microcontroller as we saw earlier, ever pin has multiple functions. Some of the important ones are Digital Pin (Input or Output), Analog to Digital Conversion, PWM. Arduino has specific functions defined for all of these. Let’s look at them.\npinMode (Pin_Number, INPUT/OUTPUT) – This defines the pin as either an input or output. This has to be done prior to using that pin.\ndigitalWrite(Pin_Number, HIGH/LOW) – This is the function to write a digital value to a pin. Digital value means that the voltage seen on the pins can only be high (5V) or low (0V).\ndigitalRead(Pin_Number) – Through this function we can read a voltage level on the given pin. As this is digital the value can be only HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V). This function returns the value which is read hence it must be assigned to a variable.e.g.; buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);\nanalogWrite(Pin_Number, PWM_Value) – The analog write function lets us output PWM on a particular pin. Please note that only pins with PWM capabilities can be used. On the Ardunio UNO (and our board) these are (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11).\nanalogRead(Pin_Number) – This is the function to read the analog value present on the ADC pins of the microcontroller. This function returns an integer value hence it must be assigned to a variable.It only works with the ADC pins i.e. (A0-A5).e.g.; sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);\nThese are just the very basics. Everything about using Arduino is available on the net. Let google be your teacher. If you have any doubts or queries, just google it.\n"},"troubleshooting/":{"url":"troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting \nOk, it happens many times in electronics that first time things don’t work out as we planned them to.

It is very similar to the BIOS that runs on your PC. It does two things. First, it looks around to see if the computer is trying to program it. If it is, it grabs the program from the computer and uploads it into the ICs memory (in a specific location so as not to overwrite the bootloader). That is why when you try to upload code, the Arduino IDE resets the chip. This basically turns the IC off and back on again so the bootloader can start running again. If the computer isn’t trying to upload code, it tells the chip to run the code that’s already stored in memory. Once it locates and runs your program, the Arduino continuously loops through the program and does so as long as the board has power.\nIf you are building your own Arduino, or need to replace the IC, you will need to install the bootloader. You may also have a bad bootloader and need to reinstall the bootloader. There are also cases where you’ve put your board in a weird setting and reinstalling the bootloader and getting it back to factory settings is the easiest way to fix it. We’ve seen boards where people have turned off the serial port meaning that there is no way to upload code to the board, while there may be other ways to fix this, reinstalling the bootloader is probably the quickest and easiest.\nWe use a dedicated external programmer the USBasp for burning the bootloader.

Now you can directly buy a IC with the Arduino bootloader pre-programmed or you can burn it yourself.\nIf you want to avoid the trouble of bootloading the IC yourself, just buy a bootloaded IC from me.\nTo do this you shall need a dedicated programmer such as the USBasp. The ArduDIY board provides a port to which the USBasp can be directly connected thus removing the need for jumpers.\nTo use the USBasp you will have to install its drivers. They are available on www.fischl.de/usbasp/\nInstalling drivers for Windows8 and above is slightly complicated. The complete procedure is given on http://letsmakerobots.com/node/36841. This link is also available on the USBasp driver page at the fischl website. It has been tried and works.\nOnce you install your drivers, just connect your USBasp to the Arduino and your PC, then use option burn bootloader.\n\nBefore burning the bootloader select the board on which you are going to use the ATmega. You can also make ATmega328’s meant for the Arduino Uno by selecting Arduino Uno under Boards before burning bootloader. For IC’s meant for the ArduDIY, just select the same options you use for programming i.e. Arduino Duemilanove and processor ATmega328\nThe programmer leds will flash and in some time you will get the done burning message. Now your ATmega is an Arduino. You can now remove the IC from your ArduDIY board and use it on any other custom board you have designed.\n"},"future_work_&_some_diy_projects.html":{"url":"future_work_&_some_diy_projects.html","title":"Future Work & Some DIY Projects","keywords":"","body":"Future Work & Some DIY Projects \nA few projects to start with which you may find interesting…\nLED Cube\nThis is one of the most interesting projects you can take up. You will learn a lot of basics of electronics and programming. For starters you can try a 4x4x4 cube and then scale up.All required components will be easily available at electronics stores.\nArduino with Keypad Input, Display\nBeing able to reliably use a keypad goes a long way in all DIY projects\n\nBattery Tester\nUse the built in ADC capability of the Arduino to test any battery below 5V.\nWater Level Indicator\nYou can use existing sensors by interfacing them with your Arduino or even build your own sensors. This will be a good practise of electronic circuit skills.\nThese are just some random ideas that came to my mind.
