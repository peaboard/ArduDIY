Some Rights Reserved.

You are free to change this hardware, duplicate it, and make your own for non-commercial purposes.

Every kit has been tested. The only active component ATmega 328 has been thoroughly tested by programming and bootloading each IC before packing. The passive components cannot be tested individually before packing. If there are any errors in those we sincerely apologise. Due to the small cost replacing the passive components wonâ€™t be an issue.

In case of errors while implementing this kit we urge you to first try things out yourself. Due to the small scale nature and direct involvement in making each kit, it is highly unlikely that a defective piece gets sold.

You can always call up the team at Sugar Plum Labs for queries advice or even if you get a random urge to discuss the string-loop theory, our contact details are given in the kit.

Any sort of suggestions, scope for improvement are welcome.

If you are interested in working with us, then we welcome you with open arms.

Special thanks to Sparkfun, Adafruit for pioneering the open hardware movement and obviously Arduino for simplifying our life.
