## Let’s start Programming!!! {#let-s-start-programming}

You must know about “Hello World” it is the first program we try out whenever learning a new language. “Blink” is the Arduino equivalent of Hello World. What this code does is it starts blinking the connected led of the Arduino Board. Let us burn this Code onto our ArduDIY.

Go to File -&gt; Examples -&gt; Basics -&gt; Blink

This shall open the code in a new Arduino Window.

Now Click on the Verify Icon. What this does is it compiles the code (sketch). If there are any errors in the code it does not compile and we get an error. A sketch can be compiled even when the Arduino Board is not connected.

Now Click on the Upload Icon. This again compiles the code but now after compiling, the code is burned onto the ATmega328 of our board.

You will get a Done Compiling message. If there is some error look at the troubleshooting section.

If everything works correctly the Green LED on our board should start blinking on/off.

Congratulations, you just ran your first code on the Arduino!!!

This is just the beginning and the sky is the limit! Everyday people are doing something new using the Arduino, take inspiration from them, and join them!

Keep in mind you will have to periodically change the Battery. Change it immediately if the board stops working or LEDs start glowing dim. The battery voltage should never drop below 7V.
