Ok so the fact that you are reading this means that you must be interested in embedded technology. Well at least remotely interested (hopefully). Or you just must be curious what all this is about. Whatever your reason be, thank you for reading and I urge you to go on till the end. Just for the reason that there is a chance at the end of this, you might learn something new. If there is anything I have learnt in all these years it is we must always learn from everything around us. In the words of Steve Jobs “Stay Hungry Stay Foolish”.

Throughout this the only thing I expect from you is the desire to learn. Please do keep in mind that this is not some local author textbook or some big reference book. I shall be keeping to the point and hence you must read through the whole thing. Every line and word.

At the end of this, I promise you will have learnt something. For some it may not be technical knowledge. You shall learn the correct approach to things. This is something that is rarely taught in our education system. Though this is the one most important skillset we need in the future.

Knowledge is not something that should be kept locked up and sold. Most of what I have learnt throughout the years is thanks to people who were kind enough to put their work online free of cost. Many workshops only give a feel of doing stuff. All the things are provided by them. Students don’t actually get in depth experience and what they learn is only superficial. While our current engineering education system does not even do that. In India, engineering is only based on how much you can learn by heart. It’s like “raat sakte ho, chalo paas ho gaye”. Even if one tries to actually learn there is basically no point as everyone knows questions are going to come from the local author book. “Yaar marks toh future mei bhaut important hai na...” The whole thing is very frustrating to those who actually want to learn and do something.

The second reason for making this is that the grasping speeds of everyone is different. I could never pay attention in lectures as my attention span is a whole complete of ten minutes. So I believe freedom is necessary. Freedom to go as one wishes, at the pace one wishes. In the end what matters is how much you learn.

The main aim of this project, for me is to reduce the prototyping time. Every year there are so many students with amazing project ideas. But our current system is such that information is not readily available and our college syllabus does not teach anything practical at all. So when students start with projects, a lot of time is wasted in doing things from scratch. When the hardware finally is ready the semester ends and the innovative ideas are lost. In a country like India with so much talent this should not happen. Ideas being lost or forgotten is a huge mistake on our part.

What I am trying to do through this kit, is reduce the time required to get the hardware ready. This will enable us to directly work on our ideas in the Application Domain. Keep in mind, this is just the beginning. You are about to unlock the path to a very interesting domain of engineering. The possibilities of what you can do are limitless. Finally, the joy we get when we make something and it works is amazing!
