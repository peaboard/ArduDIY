## Power LED (red) does not glow when you switch on the board: {#power-led-red-does-not-glow-when-you-switch-on-the-board}

*   Check Battery Voltage.

*   Have you performed a dry test? Check VCC-GND again.

*   See if the Voltage Regulator (7805) is getting an input voltage (should be around 6V to 8V) and if there is 5V output voltage present on the output terminal of the 7805\.

*   If there is 5V present on the output, check if the LED is soldered correctly along with the resistor on the side.

*   If there is no voltage at input, check all diodes, resistors and the battery connector.
