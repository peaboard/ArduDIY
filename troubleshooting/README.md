# Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Ok, it happens many times in electronics that first time things don’t work out as we planned them to. At such times remember persistence is the key. NEVER GIVE UP. You will find the problem.Just keep in mind, you will learn a whole lot more while debugging.

A lot of care has been taken in designing this whole kit so reliability is high, but due to the nature of this it may happen that things could go wrong in the components or the DIY process. Stop worrying and let’s start debugging.

Debugging is a step by step process. Start with all the known problems, then try to find one key problem and work on a solution. The most irritating problems are when multiple issues overlap and we don’t know what is causing what. At such times one must keep cool, and work patiently one problem at a time.
