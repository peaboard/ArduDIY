# How and Where to Use This Board {#how-and-where-to-use-this-board}

This board has been designed for rapid prototyping, tinkering and experimenting. The nature of this board is such that after you finish making it and testing it for the first time, it has a very high reliability. It has been specifically made such that you can make any change to it physically as you wish (for example adding extra pins, headers, specific connections, etc.).

All components on this boards are in the DIP (Dual in Line) package so that they are easily solderable and also desolderable. Hence now even if some component gets damaged while experimenting you can change only that specific component and continue as good as new. This is a great advantage as compared to the Arduino Uno we get in the market which if damaged cannot be easily repaired.

As this board has a very high reliability it can be used as a starting point in all your projects.When we start with new projects we need some reliable generalised hardware upon which we base the further project. Then using this generalised hardware we test all our project ideas rapidly. As it is a tested and reliable hardware time is not wasted in debugging of the hardware. Now once all the parts of the project are tested we can replace the generalised hardware with a specific one. What this does is it provides us with an interface we want, it eliminates the need of jumpers, connectors, breadboards and thus greatly reduces size and complexity.

So now whenever some nice idea comes in your head, just take out this board and start making!
