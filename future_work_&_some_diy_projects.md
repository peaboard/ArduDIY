# Future Work &amp; Some DIY Projects {#future-work-some-diy-projects}

A few projects to start with which you may find interestingâ€¦

**LED Cube**

This is one of the most interesting projects you can take up. You will learn a lot of basics of electronics and programming. For starters you can try a 4x4x4 cube and then scale up.All required components will be easily available at electronics stores.

**Arduino with Keypad Input, Display**

Being able to reliably use a keypad goes a long way in all DIY projects

****

**Battery Tester**

Use the built in ADC capability of the Arduino to test any battery below 5V.

**Water Level Indicator**

You can use existing sensors by interfacing them with your Arduino or even build your own sensors. This will be a good practise of electronic circuit skills.

These are just some random ideas that came to my mind. There are literally thousands of interesting projects out these with the Arduino.
