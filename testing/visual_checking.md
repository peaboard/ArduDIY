## Visual Checking: {#visual-checking}

Turn the board around and have a good look at all the soldering points. Start from the top left corner and progress towards the right line by line till you reach the bottom right corner.

Keep a look out for any stray solder splashes or dots, see that every joint is soldered properly and has a conical shape. There should not be any irregular soldering and this leads to something known as dry solder and the whole component may come off after a few uses.
