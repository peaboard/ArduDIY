## Plugging in the Atmega328: {#plugging-in-the-atmega328}

Now that we have tested most of the components, we plug in our controller. Gently plug the IC into the base. The U notch on the top of the IC should match the U on the IC base (there is a small one, observe carefully). Be very gentle about this and take care that all pins are inside the base.

If you ever want to remove the IC from its base, do so with the help of a small flat screw driver. Gently lift one edge then the other edge, keep on doing this till the IC comes out. It must be done in this way to prevent bending of the IC pins.

**The ATmega328 provided is preloaded with the Arduino bootloader.** Only ICs with the Arduino Bootloader can be used as an Arduino. That is why ICs bought from the market won’t directly work unless you burn the bootloader.

Now that our hardware side is ready, it’s time to move on to the software.

**ALWAYS COVER THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PCB WHEN USING.**

While using the ArduDIY for your projects, always keep the bottom side (this is the side you soldered on) covered. Many times we absent-mindedly keep the board on your work table as it is. Our work table is littered with wires and small pieces of metal, especially the small strands we get after cutting the legs of a resistor or capacitor. These can touch and connect two points on our board and short circuit the whole system damaging the board.

Sometimes we also need to check the bottom soldered part of the board, so it’s not a good idea to permanently close off the bottom. The best solution is to use a thick cardboard and tape it on one side of your board. This way when using it the cardboard will cover the board and if needed the cardboard can be just folded off to access the board.

Take any cardboard of good thickness (covers of our old hardbound notebooks works well) mark the boundaries of the PCB, and cut away. Stick only one side with scotch tape.
