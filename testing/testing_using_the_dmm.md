## Testing Using the DMM: {#testing-using-the-dmm}

Put the DMM in continuity mode (the mode where the DMM beeps when the two probes are connected to each other). Now the first most important thing we check is the VCC and GND. We do not want the board to go poof the moment we turn it on. The best place to check this would be the 5V Output Port. **Remember to hold the DMM there for a long while if it is showing a short. This happens due to the electrolytic capacitor we have connected. If the DMM beep does not stop even after 40 seconds, then we have a problem.**

These two must not be connected in any circumstance.
