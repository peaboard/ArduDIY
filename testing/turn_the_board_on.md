## Turn the board on: {#turn-the-board-on}

**DO NOT PLUG THE Atmega 328 IN AT THIS POINT**

Connect the battery to its connector and turn the slider switch on. The power led should turn on. Everything else should be off. Carefully touch the voltage regulator gently. It should not be burning hot. If it is very hot immediately switch off the board and plug out the battery, there is a short circuit.

After you have turned it on and the regulator is not hot, wait for about 20 seconds. Again check that the regulator is not very hot (warm is ok). The red LED should be continuously on. If everything is alright we can proceed.
